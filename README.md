This repository contains datasets and Jupyter Notebooks for use in EES 3506 / 5506 Observing and Modeling Climate Change, taught by Dr. Becki Beadling in the Earth and Environmental Science (EES) Department at Temple University in Fall 2023.

Specifically, the files within this repository contain what is needed for the Unit 5 - Mini Project 2 which focuses on investigating climate change in Earth's polar regions. Through this mini-project you will analyze gridded 3-D (latitude,longitude,time) datasets of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) from observations and climate model simulations.
